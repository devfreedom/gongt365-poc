### Implementation 
- Features
    - Scheduled daily/weekly/monthly workout sessions and notification
    - Timer-based fitness assistance (repetition/set counter and beeper)
    - Workout diary
        - Calendar-based CRUD
    - Scheduled workout
        - Needs access to native notification and background service
            - Progressive Webapp
            - Hybrid app (e.g. Webview wrapper)
    - Provide routing from current location to POIs
        - Barebone: Use Leaflet Routing Machine (https://www.liedman.net/leaflet-routing-machine)
        - Commercial-grade: Replace Leaflet.js with domestic Naver Map Directions API
- Architecture
    - User authentication
    - User account database
- Security
    - Ensure CORS-compliance
    - Sanitize inputs and queries

### Refactoring
- Frontend
    - UI handlers
        - Current: If statement-based switches
        - Refactor: Array and iterator-based switches
            - or migrate to frontend framework like React or Vue
    - Leaflet.js rendering
        - Current: Low performance when there are too many POI markers
        - Refactor: Use Leaflet.js plugin that supports WebGL
- Backend
    - Query handlers
        - Current: Inefficient, unconventional, hacky, and spartan
        - Major refactoring is needed

### Improvement
- Expand service scope by utilizing more datasets available
    - Current: Seodaemun district, Seoul, South Korea (pilot run)
    - Phase 1: Seoul
    - Phase 2: + Seoul-Gyeonggi-Incheon Metropolitan Area
    - Phase 3: + Gangwon province + Chungcheong province
    - Phase 4: Nationwide; Utilize all municipal datasets available
